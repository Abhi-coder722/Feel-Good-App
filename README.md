# Feel-Good-App :heart:
This is an android application which makes you feel good .<br>
The .apk file is bigger than 25mb so it is not possible to attach it here .<br>
The languages used are : 
<h4>:boom:Python:computer:</h4>
The application uses OOPs concept of python to switch between the pages .We can say that python is used here as the backend of the application .
<h4>:boom:Kivy:robot:</h4>
Kivy is used for the Graphic User Interface and change the presses on the user clicks .More or Less we can say that Kivy is used as a Front end design of the application.
<br><br>
:boom:Json file is used here to store the login details of the application and it is traversed when the user forgets the password .Whenever you create an account , all the deatils will be stored in the Json file .<br>
:boom:The .txt files are used to store the quotes for the specific moods and whenever the user enters anyone of them it is traversed and it shows the random quotes from the section .<br>
:boom:Then comes the images , they are just used for making the application attractive and to make it look better .
